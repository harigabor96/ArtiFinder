# ArtiFinder
This was my first bigger project, that I did in order to practice MSSQL, LINQ, Entity Framework and WinForms. I finished it in 2020-May, it represents the level of my skills of that time.

App prototype that helps professional and amateur historians, reenactors to find historical artifacts and to connect with each other.
